PlayPalate
====================================

This is a Spotify playlist generator

It's built on Python's flask framework hosted on Heroku, uses bootsrap for frontend, and integrates with Facebook, Rovi, and Spotify APIs. Also uses postgres and AWS s3 for storage, and some modules use NLTK and sci-kit learn to compute artist similarities based on NLP feature extraction from artist biographies.
